Notes on Unit Tests
===================
Be sure to clone the following libraries adjacent to your library:
* EpoxyDuino (https://github.com/bxparks/EpoxyDuino)
* AUnit (https://github.com/bxparks/AUnit)

This is a dependency for unit testing.

For example:
```
# (everything is in a "libraries" directory)
git clone https://github.com/bxparks/EpoxyDuino.git
git clone https://github.com/bxparks/AUnit.git

ls
  ... EpoxyDuino AUnit <your library> ...
```
